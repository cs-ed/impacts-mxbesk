# Impacts on Society

Integrated Math 1 with Computing and Robotics is a high school math class taking primarily students in their first two years of high school. In this course, students learn the content of the Integrated Math 1 standards while also learning C Programming and using programming to control robots. One project in the class requires students to develop a game, program, app, or manufactured item and then to market their creation to potential consumers. During the creation process, students consider the potential positive and negative societal impacts of their creations. During the marketing phase, students consider how to appeal to their intended consumers and how to create marketing campaigns that avoid stereotypes and biases.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

-Identify societal needs, and propose solutions relating to math, programming, robotics, or manufacturing.
-Present proposals and solutions to peers, and collaborate with others to refine proposals and projects throughout the engineering design process.
-Analyze past and present solutions to problems, as well as these solutions' marketing and social impacts.
-Formulate solutions which take into consideration potential positive and negative social impacts.
-When marketing proposed solutions, consider ethics and avoidance of bias and stereotypes.

### Learning Activities

Before students engage in the learning activities required for this class, they will have already studied and practiced using appeals to pathos, logos, and ethos in their English class. In the Integrated Math 1 with Computing and Robotics class, students will review these appeals and analyze past and present marketing campaigns to determine which appeals were employed, as well as how biases and stereotypes may have appealed to certain consumers while alienating others. This review of pathos, logos, ethos, biases, and stereotypes in marketing will include mostly class and small group discussions. The actual development and marketing of a product addressing a societal need will take the form of individual or small group projects, with peer review and revision throughout the engineering design process.
